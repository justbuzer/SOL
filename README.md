# SOL - An Android Assistant

This is my first Android project, and I am currently learning Android development. Don't expect anything fancy. Don't even expect it to work at all. 😅 

### About the Project
- **Purpose**: A simple Android assistant app to explore voice recognition and text display, maybe even more.
- **Tech Stack**: Built with Android SDK, Kotlin, and a lot of help from ChatGPT.

### Acknowledgments
- Huge thanks to ChatGPT for walking me through every step of the build process. I wouldn't have made it this far without the constant guidance. 🙏

**Disclaimer**: This is purely a learning project. Expect bugs, weird logic, and incomplete features. Feedback is welcome, but be nice—it's my baby noob project. 😜
